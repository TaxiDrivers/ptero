![](https://github.com/TheFonix/Pterodactyl-Themes/blob/master/pteroBanner.png?)

## Can I use them?
Sure! All of the themes you see below are made for you to take and change for your own personal projects! Or if you like them already you can keep them as they are!

## Panel Versioning
Make sure that the theme you are installing corresponds with the version of the panel you are running; no help will be given if you have mismatched versions!
## How do i use them?
Each Theme has a small code snippet that you must run inside the Pterodactyl panel directory, this is normally located at `/var/www/html/pterodactyl/` The implementation command will take a backup of your current panel in case anything goes wrong during the theme change! So you don't need to worry about losing anything you've already made!

## Suggestions
I'm sure there is something you would love to see changed, head over to the issues tab and i'll attempt on make it happen!
